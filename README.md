# UnblockMedium
Simple Google Chrome extension that removes the Medium.com paywall when reading member-only stories.

This application uses the Chrome API to find a Medium.com UID cookie and deletes it when the extension is executed. This will unblock the paywall if you 
have exceeded your allotment of free member-only stories.

I am not making this available on the Chrome web store. To use this extension, follow the steps below or in this [link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.)
